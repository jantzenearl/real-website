<p>Comparing these facts and statistics proves that BYU has outstanding language programs. Taking advantage of the programs provided makes learning a second language convenient. BYU values language programs because speaking a second language is vital for our future. If you want to learn a second language, BYU is the place to do it. All BYU Marriott students need to be certified in speaking a second language because it opens career opportunities, enhances cognitive abilities, and provides social advantages. It's time to expand your horizon and study a second language.</p>
<h2>Career Benefits</h2>
    <P>Speaking a second language will not only help you to find a better job but also expand the reach of your company. A certificate is how you demonstrate your bilingual abilities. Recent expansion in the world makes those who speak a second language in high demand. In 2019 American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages asked 1,200 employers and human resources professors about their growing need for bilingual employees (fig.2).</P>
  <center><img src="./assets/figure 2.png"></center>
    <p>According to the data collected, more than half of U.S. employers say language skills (other than English) are vital to accomplishing companies' business goals. The absence of these language skills causes companies to lag behind the global market.⁷ As the need for bilingual workers continues to grow, those who speak more than one language will continue to be able to find better jobs and earn more money.</p>
    <p>Aside from landing a new job, speaking a second language opens the door to different countries, populations, and cultures. The more reach a business has, the more likely it is to grow. Increasing a business's size will result in more profits. However, expanding one's reach is not enough. You must understand your target audience's culture and language to appeal to them. "This environment requires Americans to equip themselves with languages that will allow them to interact not only with those outside our country's borders but also with those in our local communities whose first language is not English"¹. Our world is expanding at a rapid pace. Employers' need for Billingual expertise is higher than ever, and the career benefits are beyond compare.</p>
    <p>A certification will guide you along your language-learning journey, providing you with each step you will need to take. By obtaining a second language certification, you demonstrate your ability to meet the demands of the current economy. Claiming to speak a second language without proof is merely a personal opinion without evidence. Physical proof of your sufficiency is non-negotiable.</p>

    <h2>Cognitive Benefits</h2>
    <p>Learning a new language improves cognitive skills. Cognitive skills (performed in the frontal lobe) involve understanding, language, concentration, problem-solving, reasoning, remembering, and much more.</p>

    <p>Due to the difficulty of juggling two languages, the brain uses control mechanisms to maintain balance. Constantly utilizing these mechanisms strengthens the brain and the associated skills.⁵ A study conducted in 2012 compared the cognitive abilities of monolingual and bilingual incoming high-school freshmen. In one of the studies, numbers, accompanied by a sound, would pop up on a computer screen. The computer measured the student's ability to click the computer mouse when a one (not a two) would pop up (fig.3).</p>
    <p>Results (converted to age-normed standard scores) showed bilinguals selected the correct number more frequently than monolinguals. The results tell us Bilinguals auditory and visual selective attention is superior to monolinguals. A small study, such as the click of a button, can provide crucial, relative data to those seeking a second language. Selective attention is only one area where bilinguals outperform monolinguals. Other studies have shown that studying a second language can increase creativity, improve decision-making, and even prevent dementia. Learning a second language strengthens your brain and allows you to perform cognitive skills on a higher level. </p>
<h2>Social Benefits</h2>
    <p>Studying a second language enables you to connect better with others and increases self-confidence. In business, you are more likely to be successful if you connect well with your target audience and those in the workplace. "Establishing and maintaining intercultural connections require communicating with people directly and understanding their way of living. People of different cultures and nationalities have different reactions and views over the world around us".⁸ Speaking a second language will enable you to cross barriers, helping you to better connect with people from different backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Accomplishing any task in life will help you boost your self-confidence. Because of the difficulty in the early stages of learning a language, learners often quit, preventing them from finding the satisfaction a second language can bring. When reaching a sufficient level in a second language, your self-confidence will skyrocket. Native speakers will also be amazed at your ability to communicate in their native tongue.</p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>Because of the requirement to take a language course in high school, I started learning Mandarin Chinese. At first, I only took it to check off a box to graduate. After high school, I received a mission call to serve an LDS Chinese-speaking mission in Canada.     </p>
    <p>The arrival of Covid 19 sent my mission for a spin. Instead of going straight to Canada, I served my first year in Houston, Texas. While in Houston, I had no friends to help me learn Chinese. I was confused why I was assigned to learn Chinese when the opportunity to speak it wouldn't arise. However, I didn't let my circumstances get me down. The harder it got to study on my own, the more my desire grew to accomplish the task of mastering Chinese.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I made it to Canada and began speaking Chinese face-to-face. Being exposed firsthand to Chinese culture was a thrilling experience. I fell in love with the language. On my mission, I spent any moment I could spare learning Chinese. My passion for the Chinese culture helped me serve and grow relationships with friends from China. If it were not for my understanding of the culture and my ability to speak Chinese, I would have never built these lifelong friendships. I returned from my mission this summer with suitcases full of Chinese decorations and a smile on my face. I wish everyone could experience the joy learning a second language has brought me.</p>
    <p>Thousands of students at BYU who learned a second language in high school or during their mission experience have decided to end their language-learning journey. I hope these students will again spark their passion for their second language. For those who have not yet learned a language, it's never too late. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
